  I am in the Great Sahara Desert for the third sundown in a row. Fouad and I
  pass back and forth a sun-bleached map of the stars. Itâ€™s more of a tug-of-war
  to be honest. With what remains of the daylight, we commit to memory the
  positions of spots on the page. We hope to find some correlation in its
  negative, which slides overhead as the sun rapidly dies.
